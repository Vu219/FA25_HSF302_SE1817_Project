# üöÄ Simplified Payment System - Postman Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Status: API Implementation Complete
The payment system has been fully implemented and is ready for testing! All endpoints now return proper JSON responses.

## Overview
The payment system has been simplified to remove payment forms and integrate easily with external payment merchants. When users click "pay", the system sets ticket status to ACTIVE and provides the ticket information.

## üìã Available API Endpoints

### 1. Create Pending Booking ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
Creates a booking with PENDING status, waiting for payment completion.

```

**Example:** `POST /api/payment/complete/BK20251028001`

**Response Example:**
```json

    "bookingCode": "BK20251028001",
    "ticketCount": 2,

}
```

## üß™ Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Create a Test Booking
1. Use the create-pending endpoint
2. Save the returned `bookingCode` for next steps
3. Verify status is "PENDING" and tickets are "PENDING"

### Step 2: Simulate Payment Completion
1. Use the complete payment endpoint with the booking code
2. This simulates what your payment merchant would do
3. Verify tickets are now "ACTIVE" and booking is "CONFIRMED"

### Step 3: Verify Payment Status
1. Use the status endpoint to check final state
2. Confirm `paymentCompleted: true` and `allTicketsActive: true`

## üîß Integration Notes

### For Payment Merchant Integration:
1. Create pending booking first
2. Redirect user to payment merchant with booking code
3. Payment merchant calls `/api/payment/complete/{bookingCode}` after successful payment
4. System automatically activates tickets and updates booking status
5. User receives ticket confirmation

### Error Handling:
- Invalid booking codes return 400 with error message
- Bookings not in PENDING status cannot be completed
- All API responses include success/error indicators

## üöÄ Application Status
- **Server:** Running on http://localhost:8080
- **Database:** SQL Server with auto-generated test data
- **Status:** Ready for testing

Start testing by creating a pending booking and then completing the payment flow!
